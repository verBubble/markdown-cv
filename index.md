## Project Experiences

**2018.09 - 2018.11**

**Real-time Style Transfer based on PYNQ-Z2, Team leader**

We implement the style transfer algorithm on PYNQ-Z2 by implement im2col in Cython, the network is a 16 layer network trained by PyTorch.[Github](https://github.com/VerBubbleabc/neural-style-on-chip)

**2018.11 - 2019.11**

**Real-time Style Transfer Glasses and gui interface, Team leader**

We train neural-style transfer network and CycleGAN to do image-transferring. The interface is based on Guizero and PyQt5.[Github]

**2018.10 - Current**

**Southeast Universityâ€™s 13th smart car competition, Team member**

We will use PID algorithm, which is based on the calculus, to compute the angle that car will turn.

We will code in C, and finish our embedded design using IAR.
  
   
## Research interests
