## Awards

**2018.11**
Excellent award in 12th PLD Design Competition of Southeast University.

**2018.09**
Excellent award in College students knowledge contest in Jiangsu Province.

## Project Experiences

**2018.09 - 2018.11**

**Real-time style transfer based on PYNQ-Z2, Team leader**

We implement the style transfer algorithm on PYNQ-Z2 by implement im2col in Cython, the network is a 16 layer network trained by PyTorch.[Github](https://github.com/VerBubbleabc/neural-style-on-chip)

**2018.10 - Current**

**Southeast Universityâ€™s 13th smart car competition, Team member**

We will use PID algorithm, which is based on the calculus, to compute the angle that car will turn.

We will code in C, and finish our embedded design using IAR.
  
   
## Research interests

**Algorithm:** To Know how a difficult problem solved by excellent algorithm design attracts me a lot.

**Computer vision:** In this field, ideas are really cool, such as NLP, GAN and so on.

**Brain nerve science:** I really want to know how people's brain work. Maybe one day, I will participant in research about complexity science.
