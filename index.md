## Project Experiences

**2018.09 - 2018.11**

**The 12th PLD Design Competition of Southeast University, Team leader**

Based on the PYNQ-Z2 board provided by organizing committee, we finished our project, *Real-time style transfer*.

1. We trained a 16-layer neural network using Pytorch, and saved parameters. 

2. The number of layers is decreased to 4 for higher speed. Besides, we used im2col algorithm, and at the same time, compiled by Cython.[github](https://github.com/VerBubbleabc/neural-style-on-chip)

**2018.10 - Current**

**Southeast University’s 13th smart car competition, Team member**

  1. we will use PID algorithm, which is based on the calculus, to compute the angel that car will turn.

  2. We will code in C, and finish our embedded design using IAR.
  
   **2018.11 - Current**
   
   **SRTP (Students’ research training project) team leader, the glasses of Real-time style transfer.**
   
   1. Currently, our project is getting through initial review.

   2. We plan to accelerate the whole algorithm, improve the precision( cause in the earlier project, we reduced the precision to speed up), and achieve better results.
   
## Research interests

**Algorithm:** To Know how a difficult problem solved by excellent algorithm design attracts me a lot.

**Computer vision:** In this field, ideas are really cool, such as NLP, GAN and so on.

**Brain nerve science:** I really want to know how people's brain work. Maybe one day, I will participant in research about complexity science.
